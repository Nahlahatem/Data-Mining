# Problem Formulation:

**Problem Description**:
The Speed Dating Match Prediction Competition is a Kaggle competition that challenges participants to build a machine learning model that can predict whether two people will be a good match based on their speed dating profiles. The competition dataset contains over 10,000 speed dating profiles from participants in a speed dating event. The goal of the competition is to build a model that can predict whether two people will be a good match with as much accuracy as possible.


**These Is A Classification Problem** to predict the outcome of a specific speed dating session based on the profile of two people, so we can implement a recommendation system to better match people in speed dating events. </br>
**The Input** for our problem is the various features that descripe all information abou people profile.</br>
**The Output** of the problem is a probability that indicates whether two people are likely to be a match or not.</br>
**The Goal** is to improve the matching of participants in speed dating events.

The required function is to **classify** if the people is matching or not

**The Challenges** is the dealing with noisy data, missing values, and irrelevant or unnecessary features.</br>
Also, the features included in the dataset may not be sufficient to accurately predict the product rating, which may require additional data sources or feature engineering


**The Benefit Of A Speed Dating Session** Improve matching by predicting the outcome of a speed dating session, we can identify which pairs of people are more likely to be a good match. This can help organizers of speed dating events to better match people and increase the likelihood of successful matches.

**Steps to solve these problem** :
  * Start by exploring the data. 
  * Try different Machine Learning models 
  * Experiment with different hyperparameters. 
  * Use cross-validation to evaluate the ML models. 
  * Use Different types of Searching method (like: Grid Search, Random Search ,and Baysian Search) to tune hyperparameters.
