# Problem Defination 
Airbnb Price Prediction problem to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of an Airbnb listing. The problem dataset contains over 220,000 Airbnb listings from the United States. The goal of the problem is to build a model that can predict the price of an Airbnb listing with as much accuracy as possible.


**The problem statement** is to predict the price range of Airbnb listings in Montreal based on their listing characteristics. The pricing is divided into three categories:</br></br>

   0 - Beginner: Lower price range</br>
   1 - Plus: Medium price range</br>
   2 - Premium: Higher price range</br>

The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in Montreal from 2019, including images,and text that descripe the apartment/house.</br>

We will use a multi-objective, multi-task and multi-modal approach to solve this problem. </br>

We have two different **input** for our problem :
First, image for the apartment/house and text that descripe the apartment/house. </br>

**The output** of the problem is a predicted pricing range for new Airbnb listings in Montreal, based on their listing characteristics. The predicted pricing range is represented by 0, 1, or 2.</br> 

**The goal** is to recommend a pricing range to new hosts rather than a fixed price, based on the features of the listing..
