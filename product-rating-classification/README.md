Problem Defination :

The Product Rating Prediction Competition is a Kaggle competition that challenges participants to build a machine learning model that can predict the rating of a product given its features. The competition dataset contains over 1 million product ratings from Amazon. The goal of the competition is to build a model that can predict the rating of a product with as much accuracy as possible.

The problem formulation for the Product Rating Prediction Competition is as follows:

**Problem**: Given a product and a set of features, predict the rating that a user would give to the product.

**Known facts**: The data set contains over 1 million product ratings from Amazon. The features include the product's name, price, category, and reviews.

**Objective**: Build a machine learning model that can **classify** the data into 5 categories of rating  with as much accuracy as possible.

**Possible solutions**: There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used to classify the data into 5 categories of rating. Some possible solutions include:
    * SVM Algorithm 
    * Decision Tree Algorithm 
    * Naive Bayse  
    * Random forest
